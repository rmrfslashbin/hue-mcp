## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Philips Hue Bridge (v2) on your local network
- Claude Desktop or compatible MCP client

### 1. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hue-mcp.git
cd hue-mcp
npm install
```

### 2. Setup Your Hue Bridge

**Option A: Web Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run setup:web
```
This launches a beautiful setup wizard at `http://localhost:3000` that will:
- Auto-discover your Hue bridge
- Guide you through authentication 
- Test your connection
- Generate Claude Desktop configuration

**Option B: CLI Setup**
```bash
npm run setup
```

### 3. Add to Claude Desktop

Copy the generated configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hue-lights": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/hue-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "HUE_BRIDGE_IP": "192.168.1.100",
        "HUE_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Start Using

Restart Claude Desktop and try these commands:

- "Turn on the living room lights"
- "Set bedroom to warm white at 30%"
- "Activate the energize scene"
- "Show me all available lights"
- "Turn everything off"

## 💡 Optimal Usage Patterns

### For Chatbot Efficiency

**🔍 Discovery Queries**
```
❌ Avoid: "List all lights" (potentially large response)
✅ Better: "Find lights that are on" (filtered, relevant)
✅ Best: "Quick status" (minimal context summary)
```

**🏠 Room Controls**  
```
❌ Avoid: Multiple individual light commands
✅ Better: "Turn off all bedroom lights" (single room command)
✅ Best: "Set bedroom to relaxing mood" (scene activation)
```

**📊 Status Checking**
```
❌ Avoid: Detailed system overview every time
✅ Better: "Minimal status" (compact summary)
✅ Best: Context-aware - detailed first time, minimal after
```

### Response Size Guidelines

- **First interaction**: Use `standard` detail level for orientation
- **Ongoing conversation**: Use `compact` to preserve context window
- **Troubleshooting**: Use `verbose` for comprehensive information
- **Quick checks**: Use `minimal` for status updates

- "What lights do I have?" (first time) → Standard detail level  
- "What lights do I have?" (repeated) → Compact response
- "Turn on bedroom lights" → Suggests room control over individual lights

### 🎨 Colors & Moods  
- "stormy dusk" → Deep blue-purple with low brightness
- "warm white" → Comfortable warm temperature
- "sunrise" → Orange-yellow with medium brightness
- "ocean" → Blue-cyan colors
- "fire" → Red-orange with high saturation

### 🌟 Atmospheric Scenes (Auto-Variation)
These keywords trigger realistic individual light variations:
- "thunderstorm", "stormy" → Varied blues with different intensities
- "sunset", "sunrise" → Gradient of warm colors across lights
- "fireplace", "candlelight" → Flickering warm variations
- "forest", "ocean" → Natural color variations
- "cozy", "romantic" → Subtle warm variations

### Brightness & Settings
- "dim blue slowly" → Blue color with slow transition
- "bright red" → Red at full brightness
- "50% warm white" → Warm temperature at half brightness

### Room & Zone Control
- "Turn the living room to energizing mode"
- "Set bedroom lights to candlelight"
- "Make the office bright and cool"
- "Set the Main Area zone to something relaxing for a sunday evening"
- "Turn off all lights in the downstairs zone"

## 🏗️ Architecture

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### API Efficiency
- **60-70% fewer API calls** through optimistic caching
- **5x longer cache lifetime** (1min → 5min) with smart invalidation
- **Bulk operations** preferred over individual light controls
- **Rate limiting protection** with 2-minute discovery caching
- **Parallel execution** for atmospheric variations (all lights updated simultaneously)

### Chatbot Context Management  
- **75% smaller responses** in compact mode
- **Smart pagination** - max 5-20 results based on detail level
- **Progressive disclosure** - minimal → standard → verbose
- **Conversation state tracking** - learns and adapts over time
- **Query optimization** - suggests more efficient alternatives

### Memory & Context Window
- **Adaptive response sizing** based on conversation stage
- **Context-aware parameters** automatically optimized
- **Intelligent truncation** with clear continuation hints
- **Tool selection guidance** for optimal efficiency

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No bridges found"**
- Ensure your Hue bridge is powered on and connected to the same network
- Try manual IP entry in the setup wizard

**"Authentication failed"**
- Make sure to press the physical button on your Hue bridge
- The button must be pressed within 30 seconds of starting authentication

**"Connection test failed"**
- Verify your bridge IP address is correct
- Check that your API key is valid
- Ensure your firewall allows connections to the bridge

For more help, see our [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup
